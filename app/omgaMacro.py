# this was an attemp to edit the xml directly by unzipping the docx, changing the xml, then rezipping it in python instead of using a vbs macro
# the xml is so conviluted that it was a waste of time.
# so please ignore this file

# I don't know who works on maintianing that shit, but may their god rest their soul
# if you want to see my work please go to the data\notes\process_xml(.*).py files
